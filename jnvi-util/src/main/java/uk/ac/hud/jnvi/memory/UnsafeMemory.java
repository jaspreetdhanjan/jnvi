/**
 * A wrapper class allowing us to access and use sun.misc.Unsafe methods. Using the Unsafe class is the only way

 * <p>
 * Largely contains 'peak and poke' operations. The compiler should optimize these to intrinsics.
 * <p>
 * <b>WARNING:</b> It is absolutely important that any memory allocated through this class MUST be deallocated using the
 * {@link #freeMemory(long)} method.
 * <p>
