/**
 * Defines the main API for the Java Native Vectorisation Interface. It gives us access to the plethora of low-level

 * <p>
 * All off-heap data must be aligned and of the same length.
 * <p>
 * It is essential that this class does not include any references to any non-JDK classes. This class is initially
 * compiled to generate the C header files. We do this to ensure all prior defined tests work before recompiling
 * the new changes.
 * <p>
 * Any class within the uk.ac.hud.jnvi.api package is subject to this initial pre-compilation step.
