# The Java Native Vectorisation Interface (JNVI)

## Introduction

The JNVI was developed as a final-year project as a part of my undergraduate Computer Science degree.

It is an API that exposes access to low-level SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) machine architecture through JNI. This is achieved by allocating memory off-heap as vectors and operating upon them.

The report can be read [here](https://projects.jaspreet.co/jnvi/Report.pdf).

## Features

The API supports types: int, double and float

## Usage
